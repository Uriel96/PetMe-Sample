This is sample of the Original project: PetMe. PetMe is a mobile application that a group of developers and I are currently working on.

This project was developed using primarly Javascript, HTML and CSS. The frameworks used are: Mongodb, Express, AngularJS, NodeJs (known as the MEAN Stack), Ionic and other Nodejs related frameworks.

PetMe is an application that links users with their pets through several activies, some beeing events, adoptions and social interaction.

The app currently includes frontend and backend for: sign in, sign up, home or dashboard, profile for organizations and users, adoptions and social events.

The sign in view contains the user and password authentication in order to log in.

Sign up view lets you add a new user and interact with the application, it is possible to register using Facebook (not yet implemented).

Home or Dashboard template is where the comunication between users, organizations and their pets begins (not fully implemented). It is divided into 3 parts: notifications, post and home/dashboard.

Home is where all the post from friends and different organizations are. The purpose of this page is interact with other people by seeing pictures and short videos from other their pets. Also it shows information from organizations where they can post relevant information, like tips and interesting notes about pet related topics.
